**ANKI FLASHCARD CREATION PROMPT**

Please convert the following paragraph into effective Anki flashcards. Follow these guidelines:

**SUMMARIZATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- First, provide a brief 2-3 sentence summary capturing the main concepts and context using simple english
- Identify key facts, definitions, relationships, dates, names, and processes
- Preserve important contextual connections between ideas

**FLASHCARD CREATION RULES:**
1. **One Knowledge Point Per Card** - Each flashcard must test only one specific concept, fact, or relationship
2. **Atomic Cards** - Break complex information into simple, focused questions that can be answered in 8 seconds or less
3. **Specific Questions** - Use clear, direct questions rather than vague statements or "explain" prompts[3]
4. **Context Preservation** - Include enough context so cards make sense independently[5]

**CARD TYPES TO CREATE:**
- **Basic Q&A Cards**: For factual information, definitions, and direct relationships
- **Cloze Deletion Cards**: For key terms within context, using `{{c1::term}}` format also add extra text
- **Application Cards**: For testing understanding through scenarios or examples

**FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Label each card type clearly (Basic/Cloze)
- For Cloze cards, use numbered deletions `{{c1::}}`, `{{c2::}}` for separate cards
- Keep questions specific and answers concise
- Include source context when helpful

**QUALITY CHECKLIST:**
- Each card tests one distinct piece of knowledge
- Questions are specific enough to have one clear answer
- Cards build understanding, not just recognition
- Information is broken down to atomic level
